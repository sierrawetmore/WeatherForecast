# WeatherForecast
This project is divided into two folders: `server` and `ui`. 
The `server` portion lives to hold some routes for our API calls. 
The `ui` folder holds everything else.

# Setting up
To run this project, first install the necessary dependencies:

* Navigate to the `/server` directory and run `npm install express` 

* In the `/ui` directory, run `npm install`

After these steps are completed, in the `/server` directory run `node app.js`. In another terminal, navigate to the `/ui` directory and run `npm run start`.
